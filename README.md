## Starting the server

Simply execute `npm run start` or `yarn start` to run the server for local development.
For production environments it is recommended that you use a process manager like `pm2` instead.

## Starting the client application

The client application uses `create-react-app`. 
To run it locally execute `npm run start` or `yarn start`.
For production environments it is recommended that you serve the compiled bundles directly through a web server like `nginx`.
